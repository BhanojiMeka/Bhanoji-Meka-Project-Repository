>###### **DESCRIPTION:**

In collaboration with my teammates, I participated in a final capstone project sponsored by Free Float Media. Our project focused on conducting an Empirical Examination of Board Types in Companies Based in the United States, utilizing a large dataset comprising over 56,000 records. The objective of our study was to analyze the consequential impact of director boards by predicting their categorization and identifying the influencing factors. Our comprehensive report encompasses diverse elements of our research, including literature reviews, research methodologies, hypotheses formulation, data analysis, modeling, and more. Throughout our analysis, we aimed to address the following primary question:


>###### **Identify The impact of various characteristics possessed by board directors and CEOs on board categorization and the identification of influencing factors?**

#### The path I Followed:

* Successfully executed data warehousing for a sizable dataset comprising 56,000 records, Leveraged Tableau to create visually appealing dashboards for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis.
* During the data preprocessing and engineering phase, I employed Python to cleanse the dataset and analyzed 32 new features related to board categorization based on the characteristics of the directors.
* To predict the board category with a high level of accuracy (82%), I implemented various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and more.
* Finally, I applied Python Gradient Boost to implement a meticulous machine learning process, selecting the best model out of the 14 possibilities available.

>###### **DESCRIPTION:**

In the Analytical System Technology project, my focus was on developing interactive dashboards to be seamlessly integrated into Uber's Data Analysis and Price Prediction system. This individual endeavor involved the creation of comprehensive visualization reports and a suite of drill-down functionalities to facilitate the monitoring and analysis of Uber ride utilization. Our project's primary objective was to enhance the accuracy of cost predictions for future Uber rides by considering factors beyond just distance, such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week. By leveraging Python for data visualization, we enabled the client to delve deeper into the data, uncover idle periods, and identify operational inefficiencies. This, in turn, supports the formulation of a robust business strategy to optimize the utilization of idle Uber rides and identify opportunities for cost reduction. The central inquiry we sought to address through this analysis was:


>###### **The goal to build a trustworthy brand that customers are more likely to choose over competitors.**

#### The path I Followed:

* Properly managed and analyzed to identify relevant data points and extract meaningful insights.
* Developed interactive visualization dashboards using Python to analyze and assess the pricing of forthcoming Uber rides, taking into account multiple variables including distance, weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week.
* Devised an approach to enhance cost efficiency in Uber rides by utilizing advanced techniques such as Gradient Boosting and Random Forest to predict the optimal impact time.
* Built a funtion to predict the cost of future Uber rides based not only on distance but also on weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week.
