>###### **DESCRIPTION:**

In collaboration with my teammates, I participated in a final capstone project sponsored by Free Float Media. Our project focused on conducting an Empirical Examination of Board Types in Companies Based in the United States, utilizing a large dataset comprising over 56,000 records. The objective of our study was to analyze the consequential impact of director boards by predicting their categorization and identifying the influencing factors. Our comprehensive report encompasses diverse elements of our research, including literature reviews, research methodologies, hypotheses formulation, data analysis, modeling, and more. Throughout our analysis, we aimed to address the following primary question:


>###### **Identify The impact of various characteristics possessed by board directors and CEOs on board categorization and the identification of influencing factors?**

#### The path I Followed:

* Successfully executed data warehousing for a sizable dataset comprising 56,000 records, Leveraged Tableau to create visually appealing dashboards for conducting Exploratory Data Analysis.
* During the data preprocessing and engineering phase, I employed Python to cleanse the dataset and analyzed 32 new features related to board categorization based on the characteristics of the directors.
* To predict the board category with a high level of accuracy (82%), I implemented various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and more.
* Finally, I applied Python Gradient Boost to implement a meticulous machine learning process, selecting the best model out of the 14 possibilities available.
